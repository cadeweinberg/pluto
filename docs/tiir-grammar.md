# tiir grammar

## Plan

1. Phase 1 - Scope and invariants: lock v1 inclusions (module/version, tags, symbols, function signatures and bodies, core instructions), lock v1 exclusions (full DWARF schema, target-specific syntax), and formalize delimiter/comment/identifier rules for deterministic lexing.
2. Phase 2 - C99 coverage matrix: enumerate first-wave C99 features (scalars, pointers, arrays, structs/unions, string literals, calls, returns, branching, globals), map each to canonical TIIR snippets, and explicitly mark postponed features.
3. Phase 3 - Complete EBNF: finalize unambiguous productions for module layout, tags, types, literals, symbols, functions, blocks, instructions, and operands; add lexical grammar (tokens, escapes, keywords, punctuators) and parser error-recovery synchronization points.
4. Phase 4 - In-memory model spec: define required node families (module, symbol, type, function, block, instruction, tag, operand), ownership/interning boundaries, ID/reference strategy, and structural invariants.
5. Phase 5 - Parser implementation handoff design: describe lexer state model, recursive-descent parser layout, diagnostics, and post-parse validation pass responsibilities.
6. Phase 6 - Verification and acceptance: require example coverage traceability, negative grammar cases, parse-walk dry runs, and a ready-to-implement checklist with no incomplete productions.

## Verification

1. Grammar consistency pass: no incomplete or ambiguous productions in tiir-grammar.md.
2. Feature traceability: every C99 feature row maps to explicit TIIR productions and in-memory entities.
3. Parser dry-run review: token and parse walkthrough for at least global symbol, function call, and branch-loop snippets.
4. API feasibility check: identify what can reuse current context/interner APIs versus what new TIIR node APIs are required.
5. Standards-fit check: ensure metadata and type/linkage concepts remain compatible with C99 plus ELF/DWARF/ABI intent at abstract IR level.

## Locked Decisions from Alignment

- v1 scope: core executable IR (not declarations-only).
- Pointer syntax: opaque ptr keyword.
- Metadata attachment: prefix tag-use blocks.
- Symbol identity: both named and numeric symbols.
- Debug metadata: generic tag schema for v1, not DWARF-specific node schema.

## v1 Scope (Locked)

This section is normative for TIIR v1. The lexer, parser, and in-memory model should be designed to cover exactly this scope.

### In Scope

- Module-level metadata
  - version tag syntax (`[!version: 1.0]`)
  - module metadata tags using generic key/value pairs
- Tag grammar
  - tag definitions (`tag !id = [ ... ]`)
  - prefix tag usage (`[!id]`) attached to declarations and instructions
  - list-form key/value tags (`[!key: value {, !key: value}]`)
  - generic debug metadata keys (for example: `!file`, `!line`, `!column`), without DWARF node schema requirements
- Symbol grammar
  - symbol identifiers in both forms: named (`@main`) and numeric (`@0`)
  - global symbol declarations/definitions for constants, variables, and extern functions
  - function signatures and function bodies
- Core executable IR grammar
  - labels/basic blocks
  - instruction syntax needed for first-pass C99 lowering examples (call, return, branch, load/store, basic arithmetic/compare/cast forms)
- Type/literal coverage required for first-wave C99 examples
  - scalar integers/floats/bool, strings, arrays, struct/union literals
  - opaque pointer type keyword (`ptr`)
- Lexical features
  - comments
  - deterministic tokenization rules for identifiers, punctuation, literals, and escapes

### Out of Scope

- Full DWARF schema encoding
  - no required DIE tree, no mandatory DWARF tag/attribute graph representation in TIIR v1 grammar
- Target-specific syntax
  - no backend-specific text forms for ELF relocation records, x86-64 machine ops, or ABI-specific assembly details
- Advanced completeness goals outside parser bootstrap
  - no requirement for full optimization semantics in v1
  - no requirement for complete C99 edge-case coverage in v1

### v1 Acceptance Criteria

- The grammar is complete enough to parse and represent the Hello World-style module shown in this document.
- Every in-scope feature above has at least one canonical TIIR example in this file.
- No EBNF production is left incomplete for in-scope constructs.
- The language grammar must remain LL(1) to keep parser implementation simple, readable, and fast.
- The parser can build a valid in-memory representation for symbols, tags, types, function blocks, and core instructions in this scope.

## Module Level Metadata

Preliminary v1 listing of required module-level metadata.

Module metadata may be written as either:

- single-entry tag lines: `[!key: value]`
- list-form tag lines: `[!key: value, !key: value, ...]`

Both forms are equivalent in v1.

### MLM: Required in v1

- `version`
  - TIIR grammar/IR version for parser compatibility.
  - Example: `[!version: 1.0]`
- `module`
  - Stable module (translation unit) identifier.
  - Example: `[!module: "hello_world"]`
- `source_language`
  - Frontend language family.
  - Example: `[!source_language: "C"]`
- `source_standard`
  - Language standard level used for semantic lowering.
  - Example: `[!source_standard: "C99"]`
- `source_file`
  - Primary input file path/name for diagnostics and debug metadata roots.
  - Example: `[!source_file: "source.c"]`
- `producer`
  - Compiler/frontend identity used for traceability.
  - Example: `[!producer: "charon 0.1.0"]`
- `target_triple`
  - Combined lowering target profile.
  - Format: `arch-abi-objfmt`
  - Example: `[!target_triple: "x86_64-sysV-elf"]`

### MLM: Required when object emission is requested

- `object_kind`
  - Declares intended output class.
  - Example values: `object`, `executable`, `shared`, `staticlib`
- `visibility_default`
  - Default symbol visibility policy for symbols without explicit metadata.
  - Example values: `default`, `hidden`, `protected`, `internal`

### MLM: Optional in v1

- `build_id`
- `source_hash`
- `timestamp_utc`
- `optimization_level`
- `debug_enabled`
- `target_asm` (derived convenience mirror of `target_triple`)
- `target_abi` (derived convenience mirror of `target_triple`)
- `target_object` (derived convenience mirror of `target_triple`)

### MLM: Canonical Module Header Example

```tiir
[!version: 1.0]
[!module: "hello_world"]
[!source_language: "C"]
[!source_standard: "C99"]
[!source_file: "hello_world.c"]
[!producer: "charon 0.1.0"]
[!target_triple: "x86_64-sysV-elf"]
```

### MLM: Equivalent List-Form Example

```tiir
[
 !version: 1.0, 
 !module: "hello_world", 
 !source_language: "C", 
 !source_standard: "C99", 
 !source_file: "hello_world.c", 
 !producer: "charon 0.1.0", 
 !target_triple: "x86_64-sysV-elf"
]
```

### MLM: v1 Validation Rules

- Exactly one value must be present for each required v1 key.
- Required keys must appear before symbol/function declarations.
- Duplicate required keys are a parse/validation error.
- Metadata key/value entries must use `!id` keys (for example: `!line: 10`).
- Unknown keys are allowed (forward-compatible), unless marked `required` by a future profile.

### MLM: Preliminary Grammar Spec

```ebnf
tag_def   = "tag" tag_id "=" "[" tag_list "]" ;
tag_use   = "[" tag_list "]" ;
tag_list  = tag_elem {"," tag_elem} ;
tag_elem  = tag_id [":" literal] ;
tag_id    = "!" id ;
```

## C99 Coverage

Note: this section is provisional and will be fully replaced when the C99 Coverage Matrix is authored.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    puts("Hello, World!");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

I was thinking about code that looked like:

```tiir
[!version: 1.0]

[!0]
symbol @0 : [14 i8] "Hello, World!\0";

[!1]
symbol @puts: (ptr) -> ();

[!2]
symbol @main : () -> i32:
    call () @puts, (@0)
    ret 0

tag !file = [!file: source.c]
tag !0 = [!file, !line: 10, !column: 1]
tag !1 = [!file, !line: 12, !column: 1]
tag !2 = [!file, !line: 15, !column: 1]
```

## EBNF

```ebnf

; non-metadata productions (metadata/tag grammar is defined in
; "MLM: Preliminary Grammar Spec (LL(1)-friendly)")

literal    = lit_scalar | lit_struct | lit_array | lit_union ;
lit_struct = "struct" "{" literal {"," literal} "}" ;
lit_array  = 
lit_scalar = integer | float | string |pointer
```

## Questions

what is the desire to design a new target independent IR, as opposed to just
copying LLVM's existing target independent IR?

1. it makes the project scope smaller as we get off the ground
2. LLVM already exists, so this puts us in a direct "competition" with them.
    and while I am definitely inspired by the design of LLVM, I am not
    going into this with the intent to replace them, or supplant them,
    or one-up them, I want to design a code-generation system for my own
    compiler, and I want to have it be translatable into multiple target
    languages, it is only natural to define a target independent IR to
    accomplish this goal.
3. even though "charon" is going to be a c99 compliant compiler, using this
    framework, this has little reference to LLVM, or clang, simply because
    there are so many c compilers. tcc is one that comes to mind, which is
    respected for its tiny size. I hope charon is respected as a fast and small
    compiler, which produces decently fast and small code.
